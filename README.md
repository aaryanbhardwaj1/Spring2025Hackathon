# 🍽️ AI-Powered Nutrition App  

**HackRU MLH S25 Hackathon Project**  

🌐 **Live Demo**: [just-balance.us](https://just-balance.us)  

## 📌 Overview  
Our project is an AI-based nutrition app designed to help users make the most of their ingredients. By taking pictures of their fridge, users can generate a list of recipes tailored to their preferences. Using OpenAI’s LLMs, the app analyzes available ingredients and suggests creative, nutritious meal options.  

### 🚀 Key Features  
- **AI-Powered Recipe Generation**: Upload a picture of your fridge, and our AI will suggest customized recipes based on the ingredients.  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Users receive meal ideas tailored to their dietary preferences and restrictions.  
- **Save & Schedule Recipes (Planned)**: The ability to save favorite recipes and schedule meals for better meal planning.  

## 🏗️ Development Progress  
Within the 24-hour hackathon, we successfully:  
✅ Designed and built the **main UI**  
✅ Developed much of the **back-end architecture**  
✅ Integrated **OpenAI’s API** to process images and generate recipes  

## 🔜 Future Enhancements  
While we accomplished a lot in a short time, we plan to expand our app with:  
- 📅 **Recipe Scheduling & Favorites**: Users can organize their meals for the week.  
- 🎨 **Enhanced UI/UX**: A sleek, modern design for a seamless experience.  
- 📊 **Nutritional Insights**: Provide breakdowns of calorie counts and macronutrients for each recipe.
